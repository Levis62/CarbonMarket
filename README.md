# Carbon Market Simulation

This project simulates a blockchain-based voluntary carbon market, providing tools and data for analyzing double auction-based carbon trading mechanisms in dynamic market environment.

## Project Structure

- `Code/carbon market simulation 3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the simulation code and analysis for Simulation 3: Market trading using large-scale projected transportation emissions data from 3,144 counties generated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
- `Data/randomly_sampled_data.csv`: Sampled data used for the simulation 3 and analysis. Notably, the original data (1.2 GB) is too large to put in GitHub. Therefore, we put it at Cornell Box, which is accessible at [https://cornell.box.com/s/h8tcryjzb73v34ddqsoletd5jse153in]

## Features
- Blockchain-based simulation of carbon credit trading
- Data-driven analysis of market behavior
- Customizable parameters for market and agent behavior

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements**
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Recommended packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib (install via `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib`)

2. **Usage**
   - Open `Code/carbon market simulation 3.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run the cells to execute the simulation and view results.
   - The notebook uses data from `Data/randomly_sampled_data.csv`.

## Data
- The `randomly_sampled_data.csv` file contains input data for the simulation. Ensure this file is present in the `Data/` directory.
